# KAnim

An animation library created specifically to allow the user to have multiple animations effecting a single property simultaneously with spectacular performance - later improved to be able to animate between CSS units of measurement.

It includes typescript definition files for your convenience.

## Installation

Install with npm:

```bash
npm i @kaosdlanor/kanim
```

Include the script file in your webpage and access the global KAnim or use standard imports
```javascript
import {KAnim} from '@kaosdlanor/kanim';
```
```javascript
const {KAnim} = require('@kaosdlanor/kanim');
```

## Usage

The 2 primary methods are ```KAnim.animate(elementAnimationOptions)``` and ```KAnim.animateCSS(CSSAnimationOptions)```

```animate``` is used to change a property of any object over time. It only supports numbers
```animateCSS``` is used to change style properties of an HTMLElement. It can animate between any valid CSS ```calc()``` expressions

Both ```elementAnimationOptions``` and ```CSSAnimationOptions``` are documented in [types.d.ts](./src/lib/types.ts)

Basic Example:
```javascript
import {KAnim} from '@kaosdlanor/kanim';

const element = document.getElementById('myAnimatable');
element.style.setProperty('outline-style','solid');

const CSSAnimationOptions = {
  element  : element          ,
  property : 'outline-width'  ,
  duration : 500              ,
  to       : '1em - 1px'      ,
  easing   : 'easeInOutQuart' ,
};

KAnim.animateCSS(CSSAnimationOptions);
```
You do not have to specify the ```from``` value because if it is not provided then it is acquired as follows
 - If no animation is in progress ```window.getComputedStyle(element).getProperty(CSSAnimationOptions.property)``` is used to generate a ```from``` value
 - If an animation is in progress then we continue to use that animation's from value and overlay your animation on top of it without disrupting the smooth motion of the element. The following will occur:
   - If you specified a ```to``` value the animation will eventually end with the element at the ```to``` value of the last animation added
   - If you specified an ```offset``` value then the offset is calculated from the current eventual resting place of the element rather than its current position

If you are animating a CSS variable or some property that the browser may not recognize then you should either set the variable before applying the animation or provide a ```from``` value

Some CSS properties do not support direct use of ```calc()``` in their values (eg. ```transform``` requires use of specific functions - not calc - but they can use calc inside their parameters)

Here is an example of using CSS variables to overcome this limitation:
```javascript
import {KAnim} from '@kaosdlanor/kanim';

const element = document.getElementById('myAnimatable');
element.style.setProperty('--tx','0px');
element.style.setProperty('transform','translateX(var(--tx))');

const CSSAnimationOptions = {
  element  : element          ,
  property : '--tx'           ,
  duration : 500              ,
  to       : '50vw - 50%'     ,
  easing   : 'easeInOutQuint' ,
};

KAnim.animateCSS(CSSAnimationOptions);
```


Animations can be chained together and combined with different units of measurement, easing functions and/or durations
```javascript
import {KAnim} from '@kaosdlanor/kanim';

const element = document.getElementById('myAnimatable');
element.style.setProperty('--tx','0px');
element.style.setProperty('transform','translateX(var(--tx))');

const delay = (t) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve,t));
const doAnim = async () => {
  KAnim.animateCSS({element,property:'--tx',duration:500,to:'50vw - 50%',easing:'easeInOutQuint'});
  await delay(200); // Note that this delay is shorter than the animation duration
  KAnim.animateCSS({element,property:'--tx',duration:500,to:'20vw - 20%',easing:'easeInOutQuint'});
  await delay(500);
  console.log('Done');
};

doAnim();
```
You should avoid using ```setTimeout``` for accurate timings in your animations as it is not perfectly accurate, I am also delaying the execution of each delay call by using promises and async/await. This conveniently illustrates the fact that you can add animations to an element with KAnim without worrying about what state the element is in currently or if your timings are perfectly accurate
